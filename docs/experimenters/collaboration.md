# Collaborating Through Groups

The HyperStudy platform provides robust collaboration features through its group system. Groups allow experimenters to share resources, collaborate on experiments, and manage team access efficiently. This guide explains how to use groups for effective collaboration.


## Understanding Experimenter Groups

### What Are Groups?

Experimenter groups are collections of users who:

- Share access to experiments and media
- Collaborate on research projects
- Represent real-world teams or departments
- Have unified permission management

Groups typically represent:

- Research labs
- Academic departments
- Project teams
- Institutional divisions
- Course instructors and assistants

### Group Hierarchy

The platform supports a flexible group structure:

- **Standard Groups**: Flat collections of members
- **Hierarchical Groups**: Groups can have sub-groups
- **Cross-Membership**: Users can belong to multiple groups
- **Administrative Groups**: Special groups with elevated permissions

## Joining and Managing Groups

### Finding Your Groups

To see which groups you belong to:

1. Go to your Experimenter Dashboard
2. Click on "Profile" or navigate to "Groups" section
3. View your current group memberships
4. Check your role within each group


### Group Roles

Members can have different roles within a group:

| Role         | Permissions                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**    | Full control, can add/remove members, delete group            |
| **Admin**    | Can manage members and resources, but can't delete group      |
| **Member**   | Can access shared resources, but can't change group structure |
| **Observer** | Read-only access to experiments, cannot edit                  |

Your capabilities depend on your role assignment.

### Joining Existing Groups

There are several ways to join groups:

1. **Direct Invitation**:

   - You receive an email invitation
   - Accept the invitation to join
   - Your account is automatically added to the group

2. **Request to Join**:

   - Find the group in the Groups Directory
   - Click "Request to Join"
   - Wait for an admin to approve your request

3. **Administrator Addition**:
   - A group admin adds you directly
   - You receive a notification
   - No action required on your part

### Creating New Groups

If you have appropriate permissions:

1. Go to the Groups section
2. Click "Create New Group"
3. Fill in the required information:
   - Group name
   - Description
   - Privacy setting (Public, Discoverable, Private)
   - Optional: parent group
4. Click "Create Group"
5. Add initial members


### Managing Group Membership

As a group owner or admin:

1. Go to the group management page
2. Use the Members tab to:
   - Add new members (by email or username)
   - Remove existing members
   - Change member roles
   - View member activity

Members can be added individually or in bulk via CSV import.

## Sharing Resources with Groups

### Sharing Experiments

To share an experiment with a group:

1. Go to the experiment in Experiment Designer
2. Open the "Permissions" tab
3. Set Visibility to "Group"
4. Select the group(s) to share with
5. Set access level (View, Edit, or Manage)
6. Click "Save Permissions"

Group members will now see the experiment in their dashboard.


### Sharing Media

To share media resources:

1. In the Media Library, select the item(s) to share
2. Click "Permissions" or use the info panel
3. Set Visibility to "Group"
4. Select the group(s) to share with
5. Choose read-only or edit access
6. Click "Save"

### Folder-Based Sharing

For efficient resource management:

1. Create a folder structure that mirrors your group projects
2. Set group permissions at the folder level
3. All contents automatically inherit these permissions
4. New items added to folders get appropriate permissions

This minimizes manual permission management.

## Collaborative Workflows

### Experiment Co-Creation

For collaborative experiment development:

1. Create an experiment with group edit permissions
2. Establish clear roles for team members:
   - Design lead for overall structure
   - Content specialists for stimuli and questions
   - Technical implementers for complex components
3. Use the version history to track changes
4. Add detailed notes to document design decisions

### Review Processes

For quality assurance:

1. Create review workflows with clear stages:
   - Design review
   - Content review
   - Technical review
   - Final approval
2. Assign specific group members to each review stage
3. Use comments and revision notes for feedback
4. Track review status in shared documentation

### Shared Resource Libraries

For efficient resource management:

1. Establish a consistent organization system:
   - Main folders by project or experiment type
   - Subfolders by media type or purpose
   - Clear naming conventions
2. Create and share resource libraries:
   - Standard stimuli sets
   - Common instructions
   - Reusable components
   - Template experiments

## Group Configuration and Settings

### Group Privacy Levels

Groups can have different visibility settings:

1. **Public**: Visible to all platform users, open to join requests
2. **Discoverable**: Visible in directories but joining requires approval
3. **Private**: Not listed, members can only join by invitation

### Permission Management

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary access
2. **Role-Based Access**: Assign roles based on needs
3. **Regular Audits**: Review permissions periodically
4. **Offboarding Process**: Remove access when members leave

## Troubleshooting Group Issues

### Access Problems

| Issue                         | Potential Solutions                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can't see shared content      | Check group membership status; verify resource permissions |
| Can't edit shared experiment  | Verify you have edit permissions, not just view access     |
| Group invitation not received | Check email filters; ask admin to resend invitation        |
| Suddenly lost access          | Check for group membership changes; contact group admin    |

### Collaboration Challenges

| Issue                     | Potential Solutions                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conflicting edits         | Establish clear editing protocols; coordinate through comments |
| Unclear responsibilities  | Create explicit role assignments; document responsibilities    |
| Inconsistent organization | Establish and document standards; use folder templates         |
| Version confusion         | Use version numbering in names; add detailed change notes      |
