# Organizations

Organizations are the foundation of team collaboration in HyperStudy. They provide a way to manage team members, share experiments, track usage, and control access to resources.

## What Are Organizations?

An organization is a workspace where you and your team can:

- **Collaborate on experiments** - Share experiments with team members
- **Manage team access** - Control who can view, edit, and run experiments
- **Track usage** - Monitor resource usage across your team
- **Share resources** - Use a common pool of storage and participant quotas

## Types of Organizations

### Personal Organizations

When you first sign up, HyperStudy creates a personal organization for you. This is your private workspace where you can:

- Create and manage your own experiments
- Use your individual quotas
- Upgrade to higher plans as needed

### Team Organizations

Team organizations allow multiple users to collaborate. Team organizations provide:

- Shared experiments and resources
- Role-based access control
- Centralized usage tracking
- Team member management

## Getting Started

### Creating an Organization

1. Go to **Settings** in the main navigation
2. Select **Organizations**
3. Click **Create Organization**
4. Enter a name for your organization
5. Click **Create**

Your new organization will be created with you as the owner.

### Switching Organizations

If you belong to multiple organizations:

1. Click your profile icon in the top right
2. Select **Switch Organization**
3. Choose the organization you want to work in

All experiments and data you see will be scoped to the selected organization.

## Organization Roles

Organizations use a role-based access system to control what members can do:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control over the organization, including billing and deletion |
| **Admin** | Can manage members, settings, and experiments |
| **Member** | Can create and manage their own experiments |
| **Guest** | Limited access to shared experiments only |

See [Member Management](./members.md) for details on roles and permissions.

## Quotas and Plans

Each organization has resource quotas based on its plan:

- **Free** - For individual researchers getting started
- **Pro** - For research teams and labs
- **Enterprise** - For institutions with advanced needs

See [Usage & Quotas](./usage-quotas.md) for details on monitoring usage, and [Billing & Plans](./billing.md) for plan comparisons.
