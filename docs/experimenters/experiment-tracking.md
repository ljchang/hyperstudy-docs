# Experiment Tracking

:::info Moved to Deployments
Experiment tracking is now part of the **Deployments** system. Each deployment includes inline session tracking with real-time monitoring, status badges, and session controls.

See the [Deployments](./deployments.md#session-tracking) guide for complete documentation on session monitoring, including:

- Real-time session table with status, participants, current state, and time tracking
- Status badges (Active, Waiting, Stuck, Completed, Abandoned)
- Session controls (Advance, Reset, End)
- Stuck session detection and handling
- Real-time WebSocket updates
