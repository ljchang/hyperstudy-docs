# Joining Experiments

This guide explains how to join experiments on the HyperStudy platform. As a participant, you'll typically receive an invitation to take part in an experiment, which you can join at the scheduled time or sometimes at your convenience.

## Finding Available Experiments

There are several ways you might be invited to participate in an experiment:

### Direct Invitations

The most common way to join an experiment is through a direct invitation:

1. You'll receive an email with an invitation link
2. The email will typically include:
   - Experiment name and brief description
   - Scheduled date and time (if applicable)
   - Name of the researcher/laboratory
   - Participation link
   - Any preparation instructions


### Participant Dashboard

If you already have an account, you can also find available experiments on your dashboard:

1. Log in to your participant account
2. On your dashboard, look for the "Available Experiments" section
3. You'll see a list of experiments you've been invited to
4. Click on an experiment to view details and join


### Public Experiments

Some experiments may be open to public participation:

1. These may be accessible through a publicly shared link
2. You might find them listed on a research laboratory's website
3. They could be promoted on participant recruitment platforms
4. You may still need to register before participating

## Scheduling and Timing

Experiments have different scheduling requirements:

### Scheduled Experiments

Many experiments happen at specific times:

1. Your invitation will include the scheduled date and time
2. You'll typically receive a reminder email before the scheduled time
3. You should join a few minutes early to set up your devices
4. If you can't make the scheduled time, contact the researcher as soon as possible

### Self-Paced Experiments

Some experiments can be completed at your convenience:

1. These have flexible timing within a broader availability window
2. You can start when you're ready during the available period
3. Once started, you may need to complete the entire experiment in one session
4. The invitation will indicate the estimated duration

### Waiting Room Experiments

For experiments with multiple participants:

1. Participants join a waiting room before the experiment starts
2. The experiment begins when all required participants are present
3. You may see a countdown timer when the room is filling up
4. If you leave the waiting room, your spot may be given to another participant

## Joining an Experiment

### From Your Dashboard

To join from your dashboard:

1. Log in to your participant account
2. Find the experiment under "Available Experiments"
3. Click the "Join" or "Enter" button next to the experiment
4. You'll be taken to the experiment entry point

### Joining a Scheduled Session

For experiments with specific times:

1. Join at or slightly before the scheduled time
2. Have your device and environment ready
3. Complete any pre-experiment setup (device testing, etc.)
4. Be prepared to stay for the entire duration

## Pre-Experiment Setup

Before the experiment begins, you may need to complete some setup steps:

### Device Testing

:::tip Use the Device Tester First
We strongly recommend using the [Device Tester](https://hyperstudy.io/devicetester) before your scheduled experiment time to ensure everything is working properly. See our [Device Testing Guide](./device-testing.md) for detailed instructions.
:::

During experiment setup, you may see an integrated device test:

1. You'll see a device testing screen
2. Follow the instructions to test your:
   - Camera (if required for the experiment)
   - Microphone (if required for the experiment)
   - Speakers/headphones
   - Internet connection stability

### Browser Permissions

You'll need to grant the necessary permissions:

1. Your browser will prompt for permission to access your camera and microphone
2. Click "Allow" when prompted
3. If you accidentally deny permissions, refresh the page and grant permissions when prompted

### Environment Check

Some experiments may ask you to:

1. Adjust your lighting so your face is clearly visible
2. Find a quiet location to minimize background noise
3. Position your camera at eye level
4. Close other applications that might cause distractions
5. Turn off notifications on your device

## The Waiting Room

After setup, you'll often enter a waiting room:


In the waiting room:

1. You'll see who else has joined (if the experiment involves multiple participants)
2. There may be a countdown timer showing when the experiment will begin
3. You might see instructions or orientation information
4. You can test that your audio and video are working properly
5. You'll be automatically moved to the experiment when it begins

## Experiment Participation

Once the experiment begins:

1. Follow on-screen instructions carefully
2. Complete tasks as directed
3. Respond honestly to questions
4. Stay focused and avoid distractions
5. Communicate with other participants if required

The experiment will consist of different states or phases, each with specific activities or tasks to complete.

## Leaving an Experiment

### Normal Completion

Most experiments have a clear ending:

1. You'll reach a completion screen
2. There may be debriefing information
3. You might be asked to complete a post-experiment questionnaire
4. Click any "Complete" or "Finish" buttons as directed

### Early Exit (If Necessary)

If you absolutely must leave early:

1. Look for an "Exit" button if available
2. If none exists, you can close the browser tab
3. Be aware that leaving early may impact:
   - Your compensation (if applicable)
   - The experience of other participants
   - The research data quality

### Technical Issues

If you encounter technical problems:

1. Try refreshing the page if the interface stops responding
2. Use the chat or help function if available
3. Check your internet connection
4. If you can't continue, contact the researcher using the information in your invitation

## After the Experiment

After completing an experiment:

1. You may receive a confirmation of completion
2. Look for information about compensation (if applicable)
3. You might be asked to participate in follow-up experiments
4. Your dashboard will show your participation history

## Privacy and Data

During experiments:

1. Your responses will be recorded according to the research protocol
2. Your video/audio may be recorded if specified in the consent form
3. All data collection should be clearly disclosed before you begin
4. You can typically withdraw consent at any time
